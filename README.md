This uses the curses module to make simple ascii graphic raycasting engine. 

I had this idea to implement this raycaster a year or two before finally making this initial prototype but didn't have the skills to get it off the ground. 

A lot of my difficulties were from not properly handling out of bounds cases causing the program to crash. Once these were handled the code peformed as expected.
